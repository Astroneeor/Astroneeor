# 👋 Hey, I'm Neeor Alam

I’m an innovator driven by real-world impact — building at the intersection of emerging tech, human needs, and bold curiosity.

🔬 Currently exploring:
- 🧠 **Biotech** & neuroscience-inspired computing
- ⚙️ **Lab automation** with robotics + AI for scalable healthcare research
- 🤖 **IoT systems** because of general robotics and systems that are cool

---

## 🛠️ Tech I Use
- **FrontEnd**: Understand Typescript, Javascript, HTML and CSS fairly well
  - **Frameworks & Tools**: React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Electron, Tailwind, Flask  
- **Hardware**: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP32, 3D printers, sensor networks, Linux, CustomBuilts  
- **Other**: Git, Figma, LaTeX, SolidWorks, Fusion360, MATLAB, Firebase

---

## 🔧 Notable Projects
- **🧪 Opentrons Automation** – Lab Automation for cells to reduce the barrier of entry into biology
- **Bunch of Hackathons** - I've done my fair share of hackathons where I mainly worked on ideation and front end development
- **NaoNao Assistant** - A voice assistant I made specifically to help me type stuff how better, (I know Windows+H exists)

---

## 🚀 What I'm Working On
- Merging AI + robotics in biomedical labs  
- Creating affordable bio-data collection systems  
- Generally making things that challenge me
- Learning embedded systems for smarter assistive devices

## 🧠 Bonus
- Always down to talk startups, mental clarity, systems design, or how to build things that *actually help people*.  
- Big believer in learning → building → reflecting → iterating.  
- I document my failures too. They’re half the fun.
